This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript where type compatibility doesn't always guarantee runtime correctness.  The `combine` function appears valid from a TypeScript perspective, yet it produces a runtime error due to attempting to concatenate a string and a number directly.  The solution illustrates how to correctly handle such situations to prevent runtime exceptions.
